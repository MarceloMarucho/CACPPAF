# CACPPAF
CACPPAF (COMSOL Application to Characterize Polyelectrolyte Properties of Actin Filaments), 
is an online COMSOL Multiphysics (http://marucholab.physics.utsa.edu:2036) tool for educators 
and researchers. This tool allows expert and non-expert users to numerically evaluate the 
electric potential, ionic concentration distribution, velocity profile, and ionic current 
along a molecular structure surface characterizing actin filaments. 
As a unique feature,our software accounts for surface roughness on the filament surface, 
the finite filament size, and the ion condensation effects on these
polyelectrolyte properties. To increase accuracy, CACPPAF uses a molecular
structure model for wild-type actin filaments and implements the solution
for non-linear PB without increasing substantially the computational
cost. Additionally, the user can change predefined input parameters
such as the temperature, voltage input, ion concentrations, and filament
surface charge density to study actin filaments in various conditions.
The software does not require knowledge of specific programming languages
or expertise in computational modeling and comes with a detailed user
guide. CACPPAF was recently used to characterize ionic currents along
wild-type actin filaments in physiological conditions.
It was found that the irregular shape of the filament structure model
generated pockets, or hot spots, where the current density reached
higher or lower magnitudes than those in neighboring areas throughout
the filament surface. It also revealed the formation of a well-defined
asymmetric electrical double layer with a thickness larger than that
commonly used for symmetric models.
Additionally, users can download the desktop application to their local machines.
Running the application locally requires users to have their own COMSOL
Multiphysics and Chemical Reaction Engineering Module
licenses. Additionally, the performance will highly depend upon their
machine's capabilities. For instance, a PC with 64-bit Windows 10,
24 GB RAM, and 12 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU W3680 @ 3.33GHz processor will
take approximately 30 minutes to run the simulation, and use up to
85\% of RAM Memory.
